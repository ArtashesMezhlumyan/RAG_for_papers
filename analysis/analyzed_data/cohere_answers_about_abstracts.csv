"What is the level of agreement between the fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics for the production of massive photon pairs and data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and what predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data?","  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is
presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

"How do the colored pebbles in the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game algorithm contribute to characterizing sparse graphs and solving tree decomposition problems?","  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.
",0704.0002,"The $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors is a graph construction rule that produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition. In this game, played on a finite set of vertices, each edge is assigned a color by placing colored pebbles on the vertices and edges. This coloring partitions the graph into $k$ different colors. 

The main result of the paper is Theorem 1, which states that a graph $G$ is $(k,\ell)$-sparse if and only if it is a pebble-game graph. This means that sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs are equivalent. 

The $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors provides a new characterization of sparse graphs and offers a simple construction rule to generate them. The colors of the pebbles help identify monochromatic paths and ensure certain invariants, such as forcing these paths to end at vertices with pebbles of the same color. This leads to the sparsity of the constructed graphs, as shown in Lemma 8. 

Additionally, the paper discusses the connection between pebble-game decompositions and tree decompositions. Pebble-game decompositions are a strengthening of the pebble games to include colors, and they play a crucial role in certifying sparsity. Tree decompositions are a way to break down a graph into simpler structures, providing a hierarchical representation of the graph's connectivity. The pebble-game decompositions provide insights into understanding and solving tree decomposition problems for sparse graphs."
"What evidence supports the dark matter field fluid model for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system, and how does it differ from the traditional theory of tidal friction?","  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).
",0704.0003,"The dark matter field fluid model is supported by the current behavior and data of the Earth-Moon system, with the model's predicted pattern of evolution aligning closely with geological and fossil evidence. This includes the closest distance of the Moon to Earth 4.5 billion years ago, which was about 259,000 km—well beyond the Roche's limit. This distance suggests that tidal friction may not be the primary driver of the Earth-Moon system's evolution. 

In contrast, the traditional theory of tidal friction proposes that the Moon formed from the debris of a giant impact with the Earth during the planet-forming period. This theory suggests that the Moon was once much closer to the Earth and has been receding over time due to the conservation of angular momentum in the system. The tidal friction theories also explain the present rate of tidal dissipation by invoking a resonance in the response function of the ocean. 

The dark matter field fluid model, on the other hand, is a non-Newtonian approach that does not rely on assumptions about past geological or physical conditions. It predicts that the dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field fluid is negligible compared to the gravitational force between the Moon and the Earth. This model also provides a value for the average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data."
What is the significance of the sign-reversing involution in evaluating the determinant of Stirling cycle numbers for unlabeled acyclic single-source automata?,"  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to
certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the
determinant.
",0704.0004,"The sign-reversing involution is a crucial step in evaluating the determinant of Stirling cycle numbers for unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. It helps to simplify the determinant calculation by canceling out the negative weights (-1) in the sum of signed products that defines the determinant. This involution plays a key role in showing that the determinant counts the codes for column-marked subdiagonal paths, which are used to represent these automata."
How does the use of the dyadic grid help in computing the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm for $\alpha\ge 0$?,"  In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge
0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of
the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.
",0704.0005,"The dyadic grid is used to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm for $\alpha\ge 0$ by describing the Hardy spaces $H_p(RN)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms. This result is a consequence of the relationship between the dyadic grid and the description of $H_p(RN)$, allowing for an alternative approach to calculating the norm."
What is the significance of the correction of the Bose enhancement factor in the study of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance?,"  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with
tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair
wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by
the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a
three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are
examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.
",0704.0006,"The correction of the Bose enhancement factor is significant in understanding the behavior of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. This correction factor accounts for the deviation of the gas from ideal bosonic behavior when pairs of atoms are added or removed. By examining the ratio χM+1/χM, where χM is the normalization factor, researchers can quantify the bosonic character of the paired atoms. This ratio serves as an indicator of how closely the system behaves like an ideal boson, with a value of 1 indicating perfect bosonic behavior. Deviations from this ideal value provide insights into the statistics and behavior of interacting fermionic atoms within the gas."
"How does the polymer representation of quantum mechanics, particularly in loop quantum cosmology, relate to the ordinary Schroedinger theory and what implications does this have for understanding Planck scale physics?","  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.
",0704.0007,"The paper explores the relationship between the ordinary Schrödinger theory and the polymer description in loop quantum cosmology, a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity. The polymer representation is a non-standard and ""exotic"" representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems. 

In the first part of the paper, the authors derive polymer quantum mechanics from the ordinary Schrödinger theory, showing that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. This involves considering a specific reformulation of the ordinary Schrödinger representation. 

The implications for understanding Planck scale physics are discussed in the context of loop quantum cosmology. The polymer description could provide a true physical bound on the value of certain quantities if loop quantum cosmology is a correct description of quantum gravity. This is because there is a minimum value for physical volume in loop quantum cosmology, and phase space points near the singularity lie in a region where the approximation induced by the scale departs from the standard classical description. 

Overall, the paper provides insights into the relationship between the polymer representation and ordinary Schrödinger theory, and highlights potential implications for our understanding of Planck scale physics in the context of loop quantum cosmology."
What are the advantages of using the developed numerical methods for calculating response to shock and ramp compression in material dynamics experiments compared to spatially-resolving simulations?,"  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for
applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high
accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for
composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and
shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
",0704.0008,"The developed numerical methods for calculating the response to shock and ramp compression in material dynamics experiments offer several advantages over spatially-resolved simulations. 

Firstly, they provide a flexible and robust approach that can be applied to materials with varying properties. This method generalizes earlier solutions for scalar equations of state, making it applicable to a broader range of materials. 

Secondly, these numerical methods achieve high accuracy, matching analytic results closely. They can accurately capture the physics of typical materials, including complex solids with strength and phase transformations. 

Additionally, the basic ramp and shock solution methods can be coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts and interactions with planar interfaces between different materials. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the material's response to dynamic loading. 

By directly evaluating the thermodynamic pathways during compression, these numerical methods avoid the need for spatially-resolved simulations, simplifying the calculation process while maintaining accuracy."
What criteria were used to isolate bona fide young stellar objects (YSOs) from background contamination by extra-galactic objects in the Serpens star-forming region?,"  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy
observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.
",0704.0009,"The authors used a combination of infrared and X-ray data to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Serpens star-forming region. They also compared their findings with previous studies that used infrared and X-ray observations to identify YSOs. Additionally, they considered the spatial distribution of YSOs and the extinction characteristics of the region to distinguish YSOs from background extra-galactic objects."
What are the new characterizations and proofs of known results regarding bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension in the theory of partial cubes?,"  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph
defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play
an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed
in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary
dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known
results are given.
  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and
contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes
from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite
partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.
",0704.0010,"The paper presents new characterizations and proofs for known results regarding bipartite graphs and partial cubes. Specifically:

- It is shown that a graph is a partial cube if and only if it is embeddable in an integer lattice.
- The lattice dimension of a partial cube is related to maximum matchings in semicube graphs.
- The isometric dimension of a partial cube is equal to the cardinality of equivalence classes of Djoković's relation.
- A geometric property of families Fab is used to characterize partial cubes.
- The paper also includes a characterization of partial cubes in terms of semicubes, and Djoković's and Winkler's relations."
What is the significance of identifying Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms in the context of computing Hecke eigensystems over real quadratic fields of narrow class number one?,"  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of
Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number
one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field
$\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that
are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.
",0704.0011,"The identification of Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms is significant because it allows for the computation of Hecke eigensystems over real quadratic fields with a narrow class number of one. By comparing the Hecke eigenvalues for specific primes, researchers can determine whether the forms they obtained are probable lifts of Hilbert cusp forms. This process involves examining the systems of Hecke eigenvalues of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over these quadratic fields."
What distribution properties are derived for modulo primes $p\geq5$ of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class number in the context of modular forms of half integral weight?,"  Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does
not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this
paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of
half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem
we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of
singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's
conjecture for overpartitions.
",0704.0012,"The distribution properties derived for modulo primes $p \geq 5$ of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class numbers in the context of modular forms of half-integral weight are as follows: 

- The distribution of the Hurwitz class number modulo primes $p \geq 5$ is given by the formula $\# \{n \leq X \mid H(n) \equiv r \, (\text{mod } p) \} \asymp \sqrt{X} \log X$ for $r \not\equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } p)$ and $\# \{n \leq X \mid H(n) \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } p) \} \asymp \sqrt{X}$. 

- The distribution of traces of singular moduli modulo primes is studied, and it is shown that a positive proportion of the primes $\ell$ has the property that $t_\ell(n) \not\equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } p)$ for every integer $n$. 

These results provide insights into the arithmetic properties of modular forms and their connections with number theory."
What are the applications of the congruences of Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space obtained using Ikeda lifting?,"  Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of
modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend
the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight
on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among
Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications
we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of
Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point
are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of
Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.
",0704.0013,"The applications of the congruences of Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space obtained using Ikeda lifting include:

- Congruences for the Fourier coefficients of a Siegel modular form in the Maass space.
- A proof that the Maass space is the same as the image of the Ikeda lifting for g ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4).
- Derivation of congruences for the Fourier coefficients of F (Z) in SM aass ≡ (Γ2g)."
What is the significance of the relation between string topology and differential forms in the context of Chen's iterated integrals and the cyclic bar complex?,"  In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and
differential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and the
cyclic bar complex.
",0704.0014,"The relation between string topology and differential forms is significant in the context of Chen's iterated integrals and the cyclic bar complex. Chen showed that the cohomology of the free loop space of a simply-connected manifold is isomorphic to the cohomology of the cyclic bar complex of differential forms via Chen's iterated integrals. This provides a model for the loop product and allows for the study of iterated integrals on the free loop space, which is important in string topology."
What are the different methods explored in this paper to evaluate the integrals in pure spinor superspace for the calculation of kinematic factors in one-loop and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving Ramond states?,"  The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to
manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure
spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these
integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop
and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond
states.
",0704.0015,"The paper explores different methods to evaluate integrals in pure spinor superspace and calculate kinematic factors for one-loop and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving Ramond states. The methods are applied to explicitly calculate the kinematic factors, and the paper also reviews the bosonic calculations for both one-loop and two-loop levels. The paper emphasizes the practical aspect of supersymmetric pure spinor amplitudes and their utility in constructing effective actions."
"What are the theoretical predictions for the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}, and how do they compare to the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement?","  In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons
$\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate
the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed
diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the
simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are
generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark
model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order
larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This
discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate
experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be
some unknown mechanism to be explored.
",0704.0016,"Theoretical predictions for the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$, and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ are generally consistent with those obtained using the diquark model by other authors. However, these predictions are an order of magnitude larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement, indicating a potential discrepancy that could be clarified by future experiments. If future measurements continue to confirm the SELEX value, it may suggest the presence of unknown mechanisms that require further exploration."
What evidence was found in the spectroscopic observations of EX Hya to support the theoretical model predictions of large accretion curtains extending close to the Roche lobe radius in the system?,"  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya
in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.
",0704.0017,"The spectroscopic observations of EX Hya revealed spin Doppler tomograms with velocities ranging from ∼ 500 km s−1 to ∼ 1000 km s−1, indicating the presence of large accretion curtains extending close to the Roche lobe radius."
What is the significance of formulating the problem of computing the dimension of the moduli space of self-dual strings as an index problem in even-dimensional (loop-)space?,"  We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as
regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all
odd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of the
moduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem in
even-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Letter
can be applied to this index problem.

What is the new method for obtaining a series of approximations for the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process using the Gröbner basis?,"  In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations for
the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process by using the
Gr\""obner basis.
",0704.0019,The new method involves using the Gröbner basis to obtain a series of approximations for the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process. This is achieved by considering the correlation identities and applying a suitable term order to the generators of the ideals.
What is the measured value of the branching fraction ratio RD in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue compared to D0 --> K- pi+ and how does it compare to theoretical calculations?,"  The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue
has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical
calculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the
PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction,
relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0
--> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these
results, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the
normalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/-
0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic,
and from external inputs, respectively.
",0704.0020,"The measured value of the branching fraction ratio, RD, in the decay D0 → K −e+νe relative to the decay D0 → K −π+ is given as 0.9269 ± 0.0072 ± 0.0119. This measurement is compared with theoretical calculations, and the paper discusses the shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in this decay. The paper also mentions that the corresponding decay branching fraction has been measured independently of a model, and the value of the hadronic form factor is obtained using this measurement."
What factors contribute to the development of complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization in a product-activated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations?,"  Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at
high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that
catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that
complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis
based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns
result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered
system.

What are the advantages of using stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods for Lie group integration compared to other methods for simulating the dynamics of systems perturbed by stochastic noise processes?,"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential
equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth
finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport
along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.
",0704.0022,"The advantages of using stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods for Lie group integration are:
- They can handle non-commutative governing vector fields, which is important when dealing with systems like a free rigid body or a satellite perturbed by multiplicative stochastic noise processes. 
- They ensure that the approximation lies within the manifold, preventing solutions from leaving the defined space (in the example given, keeping the solution within the unit sphere manifold). 
- They can be generalized to the stochastic setting, making them applicable to a wider range of problems involving stochastic differential equations. 
- They can be used to construct a stochastic nonlinear Magnus method by approximating the solution to a stochastic differential equation on the Lie algebra. 
- They are reliable even when the step size is small, which is a regime where other methods may struggle."
What potential do millimeter wavelength observations of the solar chromosphere have in resolving the long-standing problem of understanding its structuring and dynamics?,"  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,
remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.
Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.
",0704.0023,"Millimeter-wavelength observations of the solar chromosphere have the potential to resolve the long-standing problem of understanding its structure and dynamics. This is because millimeter emissions are highly sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere, and observing at wavelengths between 0.8 and 5.0 mm can reveal dynamic signatures. High-resolution observations at these wavelengths can provide new insights into chromospheric structure and allow for the detection of spatially resolved chromospheric oscillations."
What factors influence the formation and behavior of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film?,"  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized
stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved
Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that
the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the
lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic
magnetization takes place at the edges.
  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a
waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction
with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The
experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the
shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the
confinement.

exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function
and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich
polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and
interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.

This enables the study of excited states and provides reliable information on the intermediate coupling regime. 

The DMC approach specifically calculates Green functions in imaginary times, while the SO method is described as providing definitions of exciton-polaron properties. By combining these methods, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the system's properties and behavior."

"What is the relationship between the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point in graphene and inter-Landau-level transitions, and how can this be used to measure electron-phonon coupling strength and detect circularly polarized lattice modes?","  We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon
at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of
the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most
pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman
spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and
(-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the
strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor
dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice
modes.
",0704.0027,"When graphene is exposed to a magnetic field, its electronic spectrum splits into discrete Landau levels (LLs). The energy of the optical phonon at the Γ-point in graphene can align with the energy of transitions between these LLs, a phenomenon known as magnetophonon resonance. This resonance enhances the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the spectrum of in-plane optical phonons, specifically the E2g modes. 

The effect is most noticeable when the lattice mode associated with the G-band in the graphene Raman spectrum aligns with specific inter-LL transitions (0 => +,1 and -,1 => 0) at a magnetic field of approximately 30T. This resonance can be utilized to directly measure the strength of electron-phonon coupling. 

Additionally, the filling-factor dependence of this resonance can be used to experimentally detect circularly polarized lattice vibrations. By varying the electron filling factor, ν, the number of split lines in the fine structure of the phonon and the value of splitting can be altered. This dependence on ν allows for the distinction between left- and right-hand circularly polarized lattice modes."

Question: How does the emission of Goldstone bosons by quarks in $\XQM$ contribute to the interpretation of flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor-spin structure?,"  In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in
the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon
flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of
constituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emission
process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$,
the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the
obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a
quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in
nucleon flavor-spin structure.
",0704.0029,"The emission of Goldstone bosons by quarks in χQM is used to interpret the flavor symmetry breaking in the nucleon flavor-spin structure. The transition probabilities of Goldstone boson emissions from quarks reflect the flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking in χQM, which is caused by differences in quark masses and Goldstone boson masses."
How does tuning the phonon energy affect the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT?,"  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation
effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime
where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations
and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several
interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the
spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral
function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since
the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral
function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low
frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double
kondo peak arrangement
",0704.0030,"Tuning the phonon energy in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT can result in different levels of correlation effects. In the regime of high phonon frequencies, electrons interact with a strongly correlated Hubbard-like attraction, whereas low phonon frequencies give rise to a static potential that is essentially uncorrelated. Between these extremes, the level of correlation is tuned by the phonon frequency, leading to novel physics. This tuning effect allows for the investigation of the competition between itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations, and static distortions."
How does the crystal adaptation improve efficiency in trapping diffractively scattered protons at the Large Hadron Collider?,"  We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of
particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold
distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In
simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the
accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from
the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set
the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton
angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1
microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward
protons at the LHC.
",0704.0031,"Crystal adaptation improves efficiency by about 100-fold in trapping diffractively scattered protons at the Large Hadron Collider.

What are the potential methods for detecting non-standard neutrino interactions in a future galactic supernova using a Megaton water Cherenkov detector?,"  We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions
(NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future
galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino
propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying
special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

What are the implications of the linear and quadratic terms in the error bounds of the discrete dipole approximation for different shaped scatterers?,"  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are
bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when
the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.
",0704.0033,"The linear and quadratic terms in the error bounds of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) have implications for the convergence behavior and accuracy of the method when applied to differently shaped scatterers. 

For cubically shaped scatterers, the linear term is significantly smaller compared to non-cubically shaped scatterers. This results in smaller total errors, especially when the size of the scatterer (represented by the parameter 'y') is small. As the size of the scatterer increases, the relative importance of the linear term decreases, and the convergence of DDA becomes purely quadratic. 

On the other hand, for non-cubically shaped scatterers, the linear term reappears due to shape errors. These errors exhibit quasi-random oscillations that are not present for cubically shaped particles. The presence of these errors can impact the accuracy of the DDA method, especially for small y values. 

In summary, the linear term in the error bounds is more significant for non-cubically shaped scatterers and can lead to larger total errors, while the convergence for cubically shaped scatterers is more robust and purely quadratic for larger scatterers."

What test cases were used to study the performance of the extrapolation technique for improving the accuracy of discrete dipole approximation computations?,"  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the
discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique
was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using
many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with
refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for
cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was
demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were
proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate
shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.
",0704.0035,"The test cases used to study the performance of the extrapolation technique for improving the accuracy of discrete dipole approximation (DDA) computations involved numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters up to 160 and 40 for refractive indices of 1.05 to 2.0.

How does the number of positive steady states of a multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle vary by changing biological parameters?,"  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly
used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic
behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive
feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a
general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number
of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show
analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n
is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1
steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single
levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for
parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,
there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the
standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one
steady state.
",0704.0036,"The number of positive steady states of a multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle varies depending on the range of biological parameters. For certain parameter ranges, there can be at least n + 1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states. When parameters are near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady-state conditions, there can be up to n + 1 steady states. However, when parameters deviate from these standard conditions, the number of steady states decreases to a maximum of one."
"What are the main limitations of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) computer program in simulating light scattering by very large particles, and how can these limitations be improved upon?","  In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole
Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger
than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly
available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles
required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by
spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and
2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory.
Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally
increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times
increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a
cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program
is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of
computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large
particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current
limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.
",0704.0037,"The main limitations of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) computer program when simulating light scattering by large particles are the extreme computational complexity and long computation times, especially for particles with a high refractive index and large size parameters. 

To address these limitations, the paper discusses the use of advanced numerical techniques to reduce computational complexity and parallelizing simulations over a cluster of computers to decrease computation times. Additionally, an extrapolation technique is mentioned to increase the accuracy of the DDA."
Question: How does the discrete dipole approximation compare to other methods of simulating light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles?,"  We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a
general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We
put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking
the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the
electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects,
the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the
method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light
scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.
",0704.0038,"The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) is a well-known method for simulating light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. It was introduced by Purcell and Pennypacker and has since been constantly improved.

What is the main source of error in the determination of the quadratic pion scalar radius in \pi\pi scattering?,"  The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important role
for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain,
using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar
form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger
than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es
equations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both
values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and
show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under
tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for
some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the
resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error
in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave
I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not
yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from
QCD.
",0704.0039,"The main source of error in the determination of the quadratic pion scalar radius in pion-pion scattering is the presence of experimental uncertainties in low-energy S-wave I=0 pion-pion phase shifts.

What positivity results are presented in the framework of conditional freeness with positive conditional expectations?,"  As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of

What is the explicit description of the quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori?,"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a
natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a
classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then
proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)
in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on
a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity
assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal
object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth
isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct
a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold
which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the
quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups
of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum
double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of

the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a
quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It
is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between
observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of
quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful
for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum
coherence.
",0704.0042,"The paper proposes extending the quantum formalism to meet the requirements of general systems theory by incorporating a quantum semantics that arises from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. This approach considers the truth values of quantum propositions within the context of fuzzy sets, allowing for a more comprehensive description of the observer-environment relationship in complex systems. 

By associating a degree of membership rather than a probability value to the expression (Y QS), the paper combines the non-commutative aspects of quantum languages with the polyvalence of fuzzy logic. This union is argued to be particularly fecund for systemics, offering new interpretative possibilities. 

The use of quantum semantics in this context allows for the extension of indetermination principles to various spheres of interest for systemics, including the management of infinite cardinality of emergent propositions."
How do nonequilibrium entropy limiters for lattice Boltzmann methods compare to flux limiters for other numerical methods in terms of erasing spurious oscillations and preserving smooth solutions?,"  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice
Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without
blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the
same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes
and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction
of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar
quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)
based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven
cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.
All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic
quasiequilibria.
",0704.0043,"Nonequilibrium entropy limiters for lattice Boltzmann methods offer several advantages over traditional flux limiters used in other numerical methods when it comes to erasing spurious oscillations and preserving smooth solutions. 

While both approaches aim to eliminate spurious oscillations, the key difference lies in their approach. Flux limiters operate on vectors or tensors of spatial derivatives, aiming to combine high-resolution schemes in smooth regions and first-order schemes in areas with sharp gradients. On the other hand, nonequilibrium entropy limiters focus on limiting a scalar quantity, the nonequilibrium entropy, without affecting the vectors or tensors of spatial derivatives. 

By targeting the nonequilibrium entropy directly, the nonequilibrium entropy limiters can effectively erase spurious oscillations without introducing additional blurring or affecting smooth solutions. This is a significant advantage over flux limiters, which may struggle with preserving smooth solutions while eliminating oscillations. 

Additionally, the construction of nonequilibrium entropy limiters is based on the representation of distributions in a specific form, allowing for the design of simple limiters that are independent of slopes or gradients. This provides more flexibility and adaptability to the lattice Boltzmann methods. 

In summary, nonequilibrium entropy limiters for lattice Boltzmann methods offer a more targeted and effective approach to erasing spurious oscillations while better preserving smooth solutions compared to traditional flux limiters used in other numerical methods."
What are the key assumptions and processes involved in the development of kinetic cascades in plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas?,"  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.
",0704.0044,"The development of kinetic cascades in plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas involves several key assumptions and processes. Here are the important ones:

- The presence of turbulent motions at weakly collisional and collisionless scales in various astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar wind, interstellar medium, and galaxy clusters.
- The fundamental challenge is to understand how the turbulent fluctuation energy injected at the outer scale is cascaded to small scales and deposited into particle heat.
- The concept of a ""kinetic cascade,"" which generalizes the familiar energy cascade in fluid turbulence to the kinetic framework, is central to the theory.
- The use of simplified models, derived from the full kinetic theory, that are more tractable analytically and numerically while still capturing the essential physics of the kinetic cascade.
- The distinction between fluid and kinetic models, with the latter being necessary to describe the behavior of plasma fluctuations along the cascade pathway.
- The role of collisions and collisionless processes in dissipating the generalized energy injected by outer-scale stirring.
- The application of the theoretical framework to specific astrophysical contexts, such as the interstellar medium, accretion disks, and galaxy clusters.
- The consideration of various scale ranges and the development of reduced kinetic, fluid, and hybrid descriptions to understand the physics of the kinetic cascade in each range.
- The inclusion of gyrokinetic theory to account for the ""fluid"" and ""kinetic"" aspects of plasma turbulence and the branching pathways of the generalized energy cascade in phase space.
- The investigation of turbulent cascades of density and magnetic fluctuations, particularly at or below the ion gyroscale.
- The role of linear collisionless damping and its relation to the conversion of energy into ion entropy fluctuations during the nonlinear turbulent cascade."
How does the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction affect the propagation of undular bores in shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope?,"  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear
periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a
variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging
method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable
equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results
on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.
",0704.0045,The combined action of variable topography and bottom friction imposes certain global restrictions on the propagation of undular bores in shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope. This results in substantial changes to the evolution of the leading solitary wave. The lead solitary wave in the undular bore moves faster and has a greater amplitude compared to an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude at the start of the slope.
What is the significance of the quantum law of large numbers in proving the conjecture about the limit of entropy in certain mixtures as system size approaches infinity?,"  In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a
conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the
relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in
this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the
quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel
capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to
generalization of the conjecture.
",0704.0046,"The quantum law of large numbers is significant in proving the conjecture about the limit of entropy in certain mixtures as the system size approaches infinity. It provides a framework to analyze the behavior of quantum systems in the limit of large dimensions, allowing for the application of analytical techniques from classical probability theory.

What factors affect the accuracy of the intelligent acoustic emission source locator in locating acoustic emissions on aircraft frame structures?,"  The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part
II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two
simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.
  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is
a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

Secondly, the MCMC method can determine the noise level in the frequency domain, which is crucial for the second round of the MLDC involving a galactic white dwarf binary population. Thirdly, the MCMC technique is used to obtain probability density functions on the model parameters, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the system. Finally, the MCMC algorithm can identify the most promising individual candidate signals, and its automatic nature streamlines the data analysis process."

What are the potential applications of blind source separation using independent component analysis in non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures through acoustic emission analysis?,"  Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II
discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two
continuous acoustic emission sources.
  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of
developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various
statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is
separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source
separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve
these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability
of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission
sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for
non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission
analysis.
",0704.0050,"The potential applications of blind source separation (BSS) using independent component analysis (ICA) in non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures through acoustic emission analysis include:

- Separation and characterization of signal components from various sources, even when the signals are mixed and the mode of mixing is unknown.

- Improved accuracy in locating continuous AE sources on one-dimensional specimens, such as aluminum bands.
- The ability to locate more than one source simultaneously on a test specimen, making it a promising method for aircraft and airspace structural testing.
- Enhanced defect detection and characterization in materials with complicated geometries, such as aircraft frame structures involving bolts, fasteners, and plates."

What is the method used to construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of a Lorentzian manifold in scalar quantum field theory on static space-times?,"  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including
interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean
quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the
isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either
self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the
self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a
unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian
manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose
Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.

What are the various relationships between different types of special Finsler manifolds introduced in the paper?,"  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the
theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or
intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most
commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,
Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,
semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,
$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of
the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,
$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant
curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global
definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various
relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler
manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved
globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting
identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the
curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely
global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local
counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special
Finsler spaces considered.

"What are the interpolation properties of elements in the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$ with $0<p\le 1$ and $0<q\le \infty$?","  In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$, with
$0<p\le 1$, $0<q\le \infty$. We discuss the atomic decomposition of the
elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of
singular integrals and other operators acting on them.

The paper identifies the intermediate spaces of a couple of Hardy-Lorentz spaces with the same first index $p \leq 1$. Specifically, given $0 < q1 < q < q2 \leq \infty$, and defining $0 < \eta < 1$ by the relation $1/q = (1 - \eta)/q1 + \eta/q2$, the paper shows that, with equivalent quasinorms, $H^{p,q} = (H^{p,q1}, H^{p,q2})^\eta,q$."
How does the use of a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach affect the stability and structural parameters of graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite compared to traditional semilocal density functional theory calculations?,"  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles
theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
",0704.0055,"The use of a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. This is in contrast to traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which fail to describe graphite accurately due to their inability to treat weak vdW binding correctly. 

The vdW-DF approach is particularly important for investigating the intercalation process of potassium in graphite, as it includes the dispersive interactions needed for a consistent study. It predicts a stabilized bulk system for clean graphite, with equilibrium crystal parameters, while traditional semilocal DFT implementations do not. 

Additionally, the vdW-DF description provides insights into the nature of bonding in graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite (C8K), as well as the process of intercalation through potassium adsorption and absorption. It allows for a comparison of graphite and C8K properties, which is essential for understanding the effects of intercalation. 

In terms of structural parameters, the vdW-DF approach yields results for binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus for both graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite. These parameters are not accurately described by traditional semilocal DFT methods due to their limitations in treating weak vdW interactions. 

In summary, the vdW-DF approach improves the stability and accuracy of structural parameters for graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite compared to traditional semilocal DFT calculations, making it a valuable tool for studying these materials."
"What are the prominent features of the nematic liquid crystal model studied, including pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar phase?","  We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel

How does the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling affect the phase boundaries and orbital fillings in a two-orbital model with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell?,"  We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a
two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two
electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field
theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong
couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location
of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange
coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive
the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital
susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce
an orbital selective Mott state.

What experiments could be conducted to test the claims made about the rarity of intelligent life in the universe and the implications of the excess of matter over antimatter on the acceleration of the universe?,"  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is
very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of
the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the
evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall
develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show
that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available
resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle
of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to
survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is
indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent
life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I
shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over
antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.
",0704.0058,"The paper proposes testing the hypothesis that the excess of matter over antimatter is responsible for the universal acceleration. This can be done using a modification of the equipment that originally discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). The experiment would involve testing whether the excess of matter over antimatter is generated by a special boundary condition on the fields of the Standard Model. 

Additionally, the paper mentions that the hypothesis of intelligent life being rare in the universe could be tested by looking for other intelligent species in the universe. However, due to the limited resources argument, these intelligent life forms are expected to be rare, with roughly one species per Hubble volume. As a result, any potential observations of other intelligent life forms would be limited by the speed of light and the universal acceleration."
How does the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined eclipsing binary undergoing total eclipses constrain its position in the mass-radius diagram?,"  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing
binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf
secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.
Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the
individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04
\pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical
mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from
double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity
to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.

What are the implications of retardation effects and Coulomb distortion on the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions?,"  We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei
in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is
shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at
lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb
distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon
and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam
facilities are discussed.
",0704.0060,"Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are crucial factors in Coulomb excitation, significantly impacting the cross sections for E1 and E2 transitions. These effects are relevant across a broad energy range, from as low as 10 MeV/nucleon to as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Their influence on the cross sections highlights the importance of considering these factors when studying unstable nuclei through Coulomb excitation, especially in the context of radioactive beam facilities and understanding the behavior of low-lying nuclear states."
What are the main techniques used in the investigation of $\lambda$-intersection bodies and how do they contribute to the understanding of this class of geometric objects?,"  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects
associated with sections of star bodies and invoking
  Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier
analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized
cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to
investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call
$\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the
sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of
$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional
subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine
transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to
the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of
this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some
known facts and give them new proofs.
",0704.0061,"The investigation of λ-intersection bodies involves utilizing auxiliary statements from Section 3 of the provided text, which includes the famous embedding of Zhang's class with a generalization to cases where k is replaced by any λ (0, n). The text also mentions that examples of λ-intersection bodies are given, utilizing generalized cosine transforms. Additionally, the paper focuses on the intimate connection between intersection bodies, spherical Radon transforms, and generalized cosine transforms. These transforms play a crucial role in expressing the volume of central cross-sections of star bodies."
What is the expected maximum memory used to decode a sequence of length $n$ with an $m$-state HMM using the on-line Viterbi algorithm compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm?,"  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden
Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on
two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode
sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,
without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.
Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for
analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and
for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance

What are the ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings of possible neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge?,"  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in
non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the
standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of
neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the
process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first
experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence
of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing
efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana
experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed
study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.

What is the geometrical interpretation of the nilpotent symmetry invariance in the Lagrangian densities of (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the superfield formalism?,"  We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the
Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form
gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular,
we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry
invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the
specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism.
Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge
theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism
where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional
supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu =
0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of
the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification
in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry
invariance.

What is the combinatorial rule for calculating the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials in the family of rings of symmetric functions introduced in the abstract?,"  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an
infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is
comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure
coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their
calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new
rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in
the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the
product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a
stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive
formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using
combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from
that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the
multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general
linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.
Okounkov and G. Olshanski.
",0704.0065,"The main result of the paper is a combinatorial rule for calculating the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials, which provides a manifestly positive formula. This formula writes cν λµ(a) as a polynomial in the differences ai − aj, i < j, with positive integer coefficients."
What are the possible commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free fields and how do they relate to the Heisenberg equations and uniqueness requirements for operators?,"  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory
of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.
",0704.0066,"The paper discusses possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free fields, including scalar, spinor, and vector fields. These relations are considered from a purely mathematical perspective, without exploring their physical consequences. 

The main sources for these commutation relations are the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for the uniqueness of the operators of these dynamical variables with respect to a certain class of Lagrangians. The paper specifically mentions the ""paracommutation relations"" as a possible outcome when considering the Heisenberg equations related to the momentum operator and a ""charge-symmetric"" Lagrangian. 

The paper also mentions that the specific commutation relations depend on the initial conditions and the specific form of the Lagrangian used. The ""charge-symmetric"" Lagrangians, for example, seem to best describe free fields, and the commutation relations arising from them are further explored in the paper."
How do initial atomic-scale random fluctuations affect the correlation lengths of spatial order in self-assembled quantum dots?,"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for
nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

What open question from Petojevic 2006 did the authors answer in this note?,"  In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties

What conditions must be met in order for a subsheaf to have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it in the context of constructing invariant dynamical objects for a smooth self map of a compact manifold?,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.
",0704.0069,"The text provided mentions that when using subsheaves of the sheaf of currents, specific conditions must be met for a subsheaf to have the same cohomology as the containing sheaf. These conditions are related to local dynamical behavior and involve the uniqueness of ""cohomological classes of a given type."" 

The text also mentions that for degree one currents, no restrictions on local growth rates are necessary, implying that this condition is specific to higher-degree currents. 

However, the provided text does not explicitly state the conditions required for a subsheaf to have the same cohomology as its containing sheaf. It focuses more on the results and implications of having invariant dynamical objects and the use of sheaf cohomology in this context."
What are the implications of the dipole transition frequencies matching the oscillation of the persistent current in narrow quantum rings with two electrons?,"  The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings with
two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the
evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be
exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was
found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an
oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A
number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have
been found.
",0704.0070,"The paper discusses a new kind of oscillation found in the dipole transition of two-electron (2-e) narrow rings, where the emitted or absorbed photon has two distinct energies. The difference between these two energies appears as an oscillation that matches exactly the oscillation of the persistent current, denoted as Jo. This finding has implications for understanding the physical behavior of quantum rings with a small number of electrons in a magnetic field. 

The dipole transition frequencies matching the oscillation of the persistent current indicates a relationship between the electromagnetic properties and the current flow within the ring. This suggests that the emission or absorption of photons at specific energies can influence or be influenced by the persistent current, potentially providing a way to manipulate or control the current through optical means. 

Furthermore, the paper mentions that this phenomenon can be used to determine the magnitude of the persistent current through measuring the difference between the two frequencies. This implies that the dipole transition frequencies can be utilized as a tool to indirectly measure or infer the strength of the current within the ring. 

Overall, the implications of this finding contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental behavior of quantum rings and may have potential applications in the control and manipulation of electron currents in nanoscale devices."
What are some common features and differences between pairs of languages from the World Atlas of Language Structures?,"  No abstract given; compares pairs of languages from World Atlas of Language
Structures.
",0704.0071,"The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a valuable resource for comparing and analyzing the structural features of different languages. In the provided text, several language pairs are examined for their similarities and differences based on the WALS data. 

Common features and differences between language pairs from the WALS include: 

**Similarities**: 
- **Typological Similarity**: Unrelated languages can exhibit similar typological profiles, indicating that they may share certain structural characteristics despite having different genealogical origins. 
- **Exoticness**: The concept of exoticness is relative. For example, Burushaski is considered exotic from a Samoan perspective, but less so from the perspective of Telugu. 

**Differences**: 
- **Genealogical Relatedness**: Some language pairs in the sample are from the same language family or genus, while others are from different families, illustrating varying degrees of genealogical relatedness. 
- **Structural Diversity**: Languages can differ significantly in their structural characteristics, even within the same language family. This is reflected in the '20 most divergent language pairs' list, which includes languages with as low as 10.4% similarity in their typological profiles. 
- **Vocabulary and Typological Similarity**: The amount of shared basic vocabulary and typological similarity may be correlated. However, unrelated languages can sometimes exhibit greater typological similarities than related languages, as seen in Table 4. 

Overall, the WALS data and the analysis provided in the text offer insights into the complex relationships between languages, highlighting both their commonalities and unique features."
How does the proposed method for finding solutions of nonlinear PDEs in closed form differ from existing methods?,"  In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of
some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on
decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders.
It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s),
each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for
one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression
of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE.
Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its
highest derivatives.
  The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really
solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent
variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate
a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.
",0704.0072,"The proposed method for finding solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in closed form differs from existing methods in its approach to handling the complexity of such equations. 

While existing methods often focus on specific types of PDEs or require manual calculations, the new method presented in the paper offers a more general and automated approach:
1. **Decomposition Method**: The new method is based on the decomposition of nonlinear operators into a sequence of lower-order operators. This decomposition technique allows for finding closed-form solutions for a broader range of PDEs, including those with any order and number of independent variables.
2. **Automation**: The method has been implemented as a Maple procedure, enabling automatic solving of various nonlinear PDEs. This automation feature streamlines the process and reduces the manual effort required in traditional methods.
3. **Flexibility**: The decomposition approach is adaptable to different goals. It can be tailored to either decompose a given nonlinear operator or solve a specific PDE by adjusting the scheme accordingly.
4. **Applicability**: The method is suitable for PDEs with a large number of independent variables and relatively high orders. It is particularly useful when dealing with decomposable PDEs, where the solutions can be obtained by integrating a split system.
5. **Efficiency**: The paper highlights the efficiency of the method in handling decomposable PDEs, and it can also be applied to certain types of non-decomposable PDEs whose general solutions can be expressed in closed form.

By employing decomposition and automation, the proposed method enhances the ability to tackle a wider range of nonlinear PDEs and provides a more flexible and efficient approach compared to traditional methods."

What are the applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts?,"  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in
which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita

projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in
which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the
bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita
semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will
be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories

What are the implications of the experimental progress in heavy baryons on our understanding of their internal structure and quantum numbers?,"  There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons
in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave,
D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. After
comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data,
we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed
baryons observed recently.
",0704.0075,"The recent experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons has led to the observation of several new charmed baryons by the Babar and Belle collaborations. These include Λc(2880, 2940)+, Ξc(2980, 3077)+, and Ωc(2768)0. By studying the strong decays of these particles using models like the 3P0 model, researchers can gain insights into their internal structure and quantum numbers. 

Comparing the calculated decay patterns and total widths with available data helps in understanding the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of these recently observed charmed baryons. This analysis can provide information about the favorable quantum numbers and assignments in the quark model for these particles. 

Additionally, the study of heavy baryons and their strong decays contributes to our understanding of the mass splitting between different baryon states and the accuracy of decay models, such as the 3P0 model, in describing these systems."

",0704.0076,"The query is about the possible signatures for other sources of CP violation and new flavor-changing operators in precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model. 

The provided text mentions that: 

> Precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP violation are discussed, pointing out possible signatures for other sources of CP violation and for new flavor-changing operators. 

However, it does not explicitly state what these possible signatures are. It does mention that: 

> Diﬀerent values obtained from asymmetries in several processes, or values diﬀerent from those imposed by other constraints, could provide clues for new sources of CP violation and for new ﬂavor-changing interactions. 

So, one possible signature could be finding different values or asymmetries in relevant processes when compared to the predictions or constraints of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model. 

The text also mentions that: 

> An alternative and more direct way, focusing on the origin of CP violation in the CKM framework, is to measure β and γ in a variety of B decay modes. 

This suggests that measuring certain parameters in B decay modes could provide signatures or clues about new sources of CP violation and flavor-changing interactions.

Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of
Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to
providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown
how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.
",0704.0077,"The introduction of Fundamental Forces, or ""Universal Force,"" in our models of relativity and space-time offers a novel perspective on the General Theory of Relativity and Einstein's Equation. This new concept, first proposed by Hans Reichenbach, suggests that gravity as a Universal Force disappears and is replaced by geometry in Einstein's Theory of Relativity. 

In the context of the Dark Energy problem, recent data on the accelerating universe has led to the discovery of a new Universal Force of topological origin, which is referred to as the ""causal anomaly."" This causal anomaly is incorporated into the modified theorem, where the full structure is the sum of non-Euclidean geometry and the new Universal Force. 

By accepting this accelerating universe and the associated Dark Energy, we are forced to incorporate the causal anomaly, which provides a resolution to the mystery of Dark Energy's origin. This improved understanding of space and time, along with the modified theorem, leads to a solution for the Dark Energy problem."
"What are the implications of background symmetries on the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes, particularly in the context of spherically symmetric n-dimensional spacetimes with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell cosmologies?","  We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of
matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced
in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit
the particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysis
includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell
cosmologies.
",0704.0078,"The presence of background symmetries in the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes introduces two main issues. Firstly, it leads to freedom in the matching procedure when preserving symmetries at the background level. Secondly, it has consequences on the perturbation of the matching itself. In the context of spherically symmetric n-dimensional spacetimes with boundary layers, such as brane world models, the linearized matching conditions cannot completely determine the difference in the relative deformation of the hypersurface along the direction of any isometry of the background configuration. This is because the background symmetries introduce arbitrariness, which is independent of both the hypersurface and spacetime gauge freedoms. However, this arbitrariness is gauge-dependent, meaning that a gauge choice can be made to remove it. 

Additionally, in the case of n-dimensional spherically symmetric backgrounds, the authors Mart´ın-Garc´ıa and Gundlach pointed out the lack of justification for specific matching conditions and argued that for spacetimes with boundaries, perturbations should be defined using gauges where the perturbed matching hypersurface aligns with the background."

(u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, which

"What is the relationship between the globular cluster mass function in the Milky Way and cluster half-mass density, and how does this impact the turnover mass and width of the mass function?","  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way
depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.
",0704.0080,"The globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way is dependent on cluster half-mass density, ρh. The peak or turnover mass (MTO) increases, and the width of the distribution decreases as ρh increases. This suggests that the GCMF initially rose towards lower masses and has evolved to its current shape through the slow depletion of low-mass clusters over extended periods."
What are the implications of the twisted deformations of Abelian and Jordanian types on the D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras?,"  We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In

"What are the dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, and how do they differ based on the classification into domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type solitons?","  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite
background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an
integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the
inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The
resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under
vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the
previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and
dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of
the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.

The DW-type solitons tend to take the ferromagnetic state due to inter-atomic ferromagnetic interactions. 

The classification of solitons has implications for their spin states and collision behaviors. The DW-type solitons exhibit spin-switching during two-soliton collisions, while the PS-type solitons are in the polar state."
How does the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions contribute to the acceleration of inflationary cosmologies generated by cosmological instantons?,"  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested
density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble
in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one)
distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the
observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the
{\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained
cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological
constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages
of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within
the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the
bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble
suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,
simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of
the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.
",0704.0083,"The concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions contributes to the acceleration of inflationary cosmologies generated by cosmological instantons by suggesting a new quantum gravity scale. This scale, obtained from the upper bound of the instanton Λ-range, is given as Λmax = 3m^2 P /B, where ""m"" is the Planck mass and ""B"" is a parameter related to the inflationary scale. This new scale allows for the accommodation of the present-day acceleration of the universe, providing a possible solution to the dark energy problem."
What is the relationship between the density blowup and the formation of close-packed clusters of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas?,"  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of
clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.
",0704.0084,"The density blowup is a local process that occurs during the formation of close-packed clusters in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. The gas pressure remains approximately uniform and constant in a small area around the blowup point. This is known as the isobaric scenario, and it has important implications for understanding the clustering process. The exact solutions describing this phenomenon are supported by molecular dynamics simulations, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of granular gases and the formation of dense clusters."
"What is the significance of the universality property of covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds, particularly in the context of bosonic string theory?","  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in
space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.
",0704.0085,"The universality property of covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds is a crucial concept in the context of bosonic string theory. According to this property, there exists a ""universal sector"" where the space-time Lagrangian density evaluated on a specific set of field configurations remains the same across all pp-waves, regardless of whether they are on-shell or off-shell, as long as they share the same transverse space and background scalar profiles.

In the context of bosonic string theory, this universality property has significant implications. It suggests that there should be a set of world-sheet operators in the theory whose correlation functions are unaffected by changes in the pp-wave background or the background gauge flux. This indicates a level of consistency and robustness in the theory, as certain physical quantities remain constant despite variations in the underlying parameters.

Furthermore, the universality property has been generalized beyond the specific case of constant five-form Ramond-Ramond (RR) flux. It has been argued that this property applies to D-brane worldvolume actions, providing insights into open string tachyon condensation in RR backgrounds. The universality property also has implications for the world-sheet counterpart of string field theory in RR backgrounds, suggesting that a manifestly supersymmetric formalism like the pure spinor formalism could be used to study this aspect."
What is the main result of the functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$ in the stochastic model of one-dimensional gas clustering?,"  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of
one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles
that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.
Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles
collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass
and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the
asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the
number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our
main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on
the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states
that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of
neighbor particles.

What is the significance of the harmonic map $u$ in the context of the geometric boundaries of hyperbolic spaces $H^m$ and $H^n$?,"  Our main result in this paper is the following: Given $H^m, H^n$ hyperbolic
spaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function
$f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundaries
of $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map
$u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of
Euclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.
",0704.0087,"The harmonic map $u: H^m \to H^n$ is significant because it provides a solution to the Dirichlet problem for hyperbolic spaces $H^m$ and $H^n$. Given the geometric boundaries $\partial H^m$ and $\partial H^n$, and a continuous map $f: \partial H^m \to \partial H^n$, the goal is to find a harmonic map $u$ that is continuous up to the boundary and takes the boundary value $f$. This problem is particularly interesting when considering the Dirichlet problem at infinity."
"What is the relationship between the spectral, energetical, and temporal characteristics of radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect and the use of artificial opal on Cu plate at low temperatures?","  The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of
radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented.
Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling
point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long-
term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured
spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible
luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial
opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with
different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and
the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is
being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the
Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of
the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same
as in opal matrixes.
",0704.0088,"The presence of a photonic flame effect, where opal crystals are placed on a Cu plate at liquid nitrogen temperatures, results in long-term luminescence when irradiated by a nanosecond ruby laser pulse. The temporal characteristics of this luminescence are similar to those observed in frozen nonlinear liquids on a Cu plate, producing bright blue luminescence. The photonic flame effect is influenced by the properties of photonic crystals, and the interference effects caused by the structure of the opal matrix can enhance the electromagnetic field, leading to the production of laser plasma, electron acceleration, and x-ray generation."
How is the kernel estimator determined objectively during the calibration of an experimental setup for statistical modeling of physical laws?,"  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the
probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by
experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively
by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.
",0704.0089,"The kernel estimator is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of the experimental setup. This means that the kernel is influenced by the variation and distribution of the measured data points, rather than being arbitrarily chosen or assuming a specific width."
How does the use of Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) and Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) algorithms contribute to the development of relative risk analysis among projects?,"  Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursive
sampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)
optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple
Projects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability
distributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability
distributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on
schedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied to
develop a relative risk analysis among projects.
",0704.0090,"The Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) methodology, which includes Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) algorithms, offers a novel approach to developing relative risk analysis among projects. ROPS treats projects as options, employing Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) optimization to explore strategic Plans with multiple Projects and ordered Tasks. The middle shell of ROPS samples probability distributions of task durations, while TRD algorithms facilitate a copula analysis, transforming project marginal Cumulative Probability Distributions (CPDs) into Gaussian spaces. This enables the calculation of covariances and correlations, allowing for a comprehensive risk assessment of projects with complex schedules, such as the Future Combat Systems (FCS) project for the US Army. By combining ROPS and TRD, project managers can make more informed decisions by quantifying and comparing risks across different projects."
What are the implications of embedding countable groups into finitely generated groups with Kazhdan's property (T) and only two conjugacy classes?,"  We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of
small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely
generated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate
elements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such
groups.
  As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable
group $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$,
where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and
containing exactly two conjugacy classes.
",0704.0091,"Embedding countable groups into finitely generated groups with Kazhdan's property (T) and only two conjugacy classes has several implications:

1. The construction of finitely generated torsion-free groups: By combining classical methods of combinatorial group theory and small cancellation theory over relatively hyperbolic groups, the authors create finitely generated groups that are torsion-free and possess a finite number of conjugate element classes. This provides a novel approach to understanding and working with these unique group structures.

2. Understanding outer automorphism groups: The study of outer automorphism groups, particularly those with Kazhdan's property (T), is advanced by proving that every countable group can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a finitely generated group with specific properties. This deepens our knowledge of group theory and the intricacies of outer automorphisms.

3. Applications to other areas of mathematics: The techniques used in this context have been applied to other areas, such as understanding C*-algebraic quantum groups as noncommutative manifolds and their interactions with Connes' noncommutative geometry. This showcases the far-reaching implications of these mathematical concepts.

4. Embedding theorems and their consequences: The paper includes embedding theorems that provide conditions under which a Hilbert C*-module can be embedded into a trivial module. This has implications for understanding the structure and properties of these modules, particularly when dealing with ergodic actions of compact groups.

5. Equivariant embedding and Chern characters: The paper also discusses equivariant embedding, providing conditions for when a C*-algebra admits an equivariant embedding into a trivial module for a compact Lie group. Additionally, it explores the invariance of Chern characters in the context of quantum groups, specifically SUq(2)."
"What is the relationship between the energy density, chemical potential, and temperature in the recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite density?","  We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite
density. In particular we compute the energy density as a function of the
chemical potential and the temperature. It is shown that overlap fermions with
chemical potential reproduce the correct continuum behavior.
",0704.0092,"The energy density of overlap fermions with chemical potential is found to approach the correct continuum behavior as a function of chemical potential and temperature.

"What are some misconceptions regarding the role of phonons in the electronic self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors, and how do experimental evidences and simulations refute these arguments?","  Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated
oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions.
Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such
as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated
oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be
the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate
superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including
the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects,
the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We
show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these
arguments are not well founded.
",0704.0093,"Some misconceptions regarding the role of phonons in the electronic self-energy effects observed in high-Tc cuprate superconductors include the belief that phonons cannot account for certain self-energy effects and the expectation that phonons should not have a strong doping dependence. 

Experimental evidence and simulations refute these arguments by highlighting:

- The presence of universal energy scales in all materials at all dopings, especially in the normal state of very low-temperature materials.
- Strong inferred momentum dependence.
- The existence of multiple bosonic mode couplings.
- The sophisticated doping dependence of renormalization effects on the electronic self-energy, including observations of multiple bosonic mode couplings along the nodal direction and the influence of the c-axis screening effect on the coupling between electrons and c-axis phonons.
- Temperature dependence: In conventional superconducting materials, the energy scale associated with superconductivity is well above Tc. However, in cuprates, these energy scales can be comparable, resulting in unique temperature dependence.

Additionally, the paper discusses the role of magnetic-related modes and optical phonons in contributing to the renormalization effects, providing a comprehensive analysis of the available data and simulations to address criticisms against the phonon interpretation."
What are the constraints on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster based on classical Local Group timing arguments and potential models fitting the lensing data?,"  We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the
merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments.
We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.
{\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a
total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move
with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x
10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our
results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of
$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of
Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter
$M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le
1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.

What is the geometric interpretation of the limiting compact set that large balls in a locally compact group with polynomial growth converge to after suitable renormalization?,"  We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally
compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the
geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show
that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie
group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an
asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a
limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss
the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to
ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant
metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series
of nilpotent groups.
",0704.0095,"The paper discusses the ""shape of large balls"" in the context of locally compact groups with polynomial growth. The specific geometric interpretation of the limiting compact set is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it appears to be related to the ""Lie shadow"" of the group, which is a simply connected solvable Lie group. The paper also mentions the work of P. Pansu, who likely provides further insights into the geometric aspects."
What are the implications of the different representations of a 248-dimensional Lie algebra on the solutions to the corresponding systems of ordinary differential equations?,"  In this note we present three representations of a 248-dimensional Lie
algebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system of
five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty-four, that
admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each of
order twenty-eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential
equation of order two hundred and forty-four.
",0704.0096,"The different representations of a 248-dimensional Lie algebra are related to the symmetries of systems of ordinary differential equations. In the given text, three representations of a 248-dimensional Lie algebra are discussed, each corresponding to a different system of ordinary differential equations. 

The first representation is related to a system of five trivial ordinary differential equations, each of order forty-four. This system admits a 248-dimensional algebra of Lie point symmetries, which can be calculated using the formula: 52 + 5 * 44 + 3 = 248. 

The second representation is associated with a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations, each of order thirty-six. Similarly, this system also admits a 248-dimensional algebra of Lie point symmetries, calculated as: 7 * 36 + 7 + 3 = 248. 

The third representation is connected to a single trivial ordinary differential equation of order two hundred and forty-four. This equation also possesses a 248-dimensional algebra of Lie point symmetries, which can be understood using the formula: 1 * 244 + 1 + 3 = 248. 

The implications of these different representations on the solutions to the corresponding systems of ordinary differential equations are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, we can make some inferences. 

Each representation provides a different set of symmetry operators (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, etc.) that leave the corresponding system of equations invariant. These symmetry operators can be used to simplify the process of finding solutions to the equations. In other words, the symmetries can reduce the complexity of solving the systems by providing additional constraints or relationships between the variables and parameters involved. 

Additionally, the existence of these symmetries and their associated algebras suggests that there may be underlying structures or patterns within the solutions to these systems of equations. These structures could potentially provide insights into more efficient solution methods or reveal connections between seemingly unrelated mathematical concepts. 

Furthermore, the fact that these different representations of the 248-dimensional Lie algebra correspond to systems with varying numbers of equations and orders suggests that there could be a deeper relationship between the dimensionality of the algebra and the properties of the differential equations. This relationship warrants further exploration and could lead to a better understanding of both the algebraic and analytical aspects of these systems. 

In conclusion, while the specific implications for solving the corresponding systems of ordinary differential equations are not explicitly stated, the existence of different representations of the 248-dimensional Lie algebra and their associated symmetries provides valuable insights and potential avenues for further investigation in the field of differential equations and their algebraic structures."
